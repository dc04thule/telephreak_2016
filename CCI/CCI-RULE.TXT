
CyberCrime International Network

Network Rules and Regulations

The ONLY rules of the network are as follows:

1) DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE CYBERCRIME NODELISTS (CCI-NODE.###)!  Due to
   the range of topics contained within CyberCrime, security is quite
   obviously an issue.  You MAY spread the CCi-##.ZIP packs around,
   though be careful with those as well.  However, we do NOT want copies
   of the nodelist being spread ANYWHERE but to current CyberCrime
   members.  As far as pack distribution - don't send it EVERYWHERE.
   Upload or crashmail it only to highest-quality underground systems.
   What their orientation is, doesn't matter.  The only requirement is
   that any applicants MUST be known by at least one other CyberCrime
   sysop.  This way, security will be maintained, yet the network will
   still enjoy a decent level of awareness throughout the underground.

2) Quality is the #1 issue in this network.  Oneliners, flames, etc, are
   NOT tolerated under ANY circumstances.  Users posting any trash in
   this network will be warned once, then removed.  Three warnings against
   users on your system will spell your system's permanent removal from
   CyberCrime.  Period.

That's all.  However, be warned that I reserve the right to remove your system
from CyberCrime INSTANTLY, on any moment's notice, for any reason whatsoever.
Do NOT cross me.  However, do not expect to be kicked out the network just for
saying "Fuck off, Mitch."  It'll take a BIT more than that.  :)
